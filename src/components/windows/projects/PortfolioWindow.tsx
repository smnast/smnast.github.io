                    Many developers eventually decide to create a portfolio website to showcase
                    their unique talent. I wanted this portfolio to be different from all the
                    others, and so I decided to go back to my childhood operating system: Windows
                    XP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website was programmed using React and TypeScript. I wanted to ensure the
                    Window system was clean and would allow me to add more functionality in the
                    future. I have some ideas for extensions of the website, including adding an
                    awards window if I receive more notable awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to play around with the website, including playing a game of
                    Minesweeper!
