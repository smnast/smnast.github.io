                    <strong>Robot10</strong> is the final version of my VEX Robotics code for the 2023-2024 season. 
                    It is written in C++ and utilizes the&nbsp;

                    The robot's path was determined through a combination of online mapping tools, field measurements, and trial-and-error. 
                    In addition to driving, the robot was required to control several functions autonomously and with driver input, including 
                    "wings" (essentially snow plows, which were crucial for that season's competitive strategy) and a catapult that also served as a climbing mechanism.

                    During our final competition, there were multiple instances where the robot would unexpectedly turn around and attempt to escape the field. 
                    We discovered that the uploaded code was corrupted, and re-uploading it resolved the issue. This experience emphasized the importance of thoroughly testing the software before matches, even when everything <i>appears</i> to be functioning correctly.
