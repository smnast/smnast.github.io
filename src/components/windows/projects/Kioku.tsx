                    Kioku is my <i>very</i> informal exploration of
                    reinforcement learning (RL) research. I aim to take a
                    cognitive science-inspired approach to building agents,
                    drawing on mechanisms from the human mind that help us solve
                    challenging environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I have implemented three key RL algorithms: DQN,
                    A2C, and PPO. Implementing PPO has been a surprising journey
                    for me because of its complexity—many parts need to be
                    implemented correctly for the algorithm to work, and even
                    small mistakes can prevent it from converging. Now that I
                    have a working PPO implementation, I am focusing on making
                    it more sample-efficient and exploratory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the near future, I want to add recurrence to my PPO
                    agent. This would act as short-term memory, allowing the
                    agent to plan and iterate with a chain-of-thought process
                    (ideally).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also plan to implement dreaming, an off-policy learning
                    technique where the agent imagines trajectories using a
                    world model. This method is inspired by DeepMind's Dreamer
                    agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the technical side, I focus on writing clear and
                    maintainable code. I use NumPy for general array operations
                    and PyTorch tensors for arrays that require gradients or are
                    input to the models. I include type hints throughout and
                    document all functions and classes with docstrings. I
                    abstract complex parts of the system into reusable
                    components, such as memory management and function
                    approximation modules, to keep the main script simple and
                    modular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For environment creation, I provide an abstract base class
                    that I use to develop specific environments, such as a
                    Gymnasium wrapper or custom environments for testing
                    features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also prioritize extensive logging, which makes debugging
                    much easier. For example, in my A2C implementation, I
                    noticed that the gradient norms of one of my function
                    approximators were zero, which helped me identify that the
                    gradients were being detached. I currently use TensorBoard
                    for logging but may switch to a tool with a more
                    user-friendly interface in the future.
